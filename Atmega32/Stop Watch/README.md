# Stop Watch
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a stopwatch project implemented on the ATmega32 microcontroller. The stopwatch is designed to accurately measure elapsed time with precision.

## Overview
The stop watch can countup to 24 Hour.

## Hardware Requirements
To build and run the stop watch, you will need the following:

- ATmega32 Microcontroller
- Buttons
- 7-Segment

## Software Requirements
To build and run the stop watch, you will need the following:

- AVR-GCC
- AVRDUDE
- Protus

## Features

- Reset : There is a reset button to reset the stopwatch to zero.
- Pause : There is a pause button to pause the stopwatch.
- Resume : There is a resume button to resume the stopwatch counting up.

## Conclusion
This project is a good starting point for learning how to program the Atmega32 microcontroller. The stop watch is a simple and straight forward project that can be easily implemented and modified.
